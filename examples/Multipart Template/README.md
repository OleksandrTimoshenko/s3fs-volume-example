# Multipart document example

In this example, the contents of the header and footer are stored in distinct template files. These templates
may also refer dynamic content from the template data map.

Using multipart templates are useful in many scenarios. For example, you can store addresses, company information
or legal texts in separate documents. You can also reuse common elements across templates to make it easier to change
them in the future.

See the [Main.java](Main.java) file for usage.
